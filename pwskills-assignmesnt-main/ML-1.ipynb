    "#Feature scaling is the process of transforming the features in a dataset so they have a similar scale or range. It ensures that no single feature dominates the model due to its magnitude. Scaling is essential for algorithms that rely on distance metrics or optimization techniques, such as k-NN, SVM, and gradient descent. Common methods include Min-Max Scaling, which rescales features to a fixed range (usually 0 to 1), and Standardization (Z-score Scaling), which transforms features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Proper scaling helps improve the performance and convergence speed of machine learning algorithms."
